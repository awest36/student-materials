Business Requirement

Executive Summary

We are going to be building an application, to help students connect better, communicate with their fellow students in the same lesson plan. Since the students are going to be section off by their class, they are all going to have the same mentor. On top of that we are going to pair mind like students together. We are striving to make it a friendly environment, where students are able to questions where other students might be struggling and to have their questions answer by their mentor or other students that might know the answer.
We don’t want to build separate application from exeter. We want to integrate into exeter. We want it to be available at all time. Through the lesson plans and even the home page. It should be easy to access over all, and to see what your peers are posting on the the chat. 
The application will help students strive in their class and help with connecting with people, and getting themselves out for the world. We all want see this happen, to make it a fun, friendly environment. As the student go along through their course they will be pair when people are the think just alike. There will be suggestions that will pop up to let you talk to them cause yall are similar.  

Business Objectives

The importance of this is to make it easy for the students to connect and to communicate with each other. Allowing them to exceed in their field, and to have all their questions answered. Also while doing this, pairing student that the same thinking process as each other. This project will need to be integrated in the exeter  allow the student to have full access to the chat. We will want to have this done in the next year or less for the students and the mentors to try out and see how it will work, and to fix all the bugs that it might have. To see if it will be a success to the online school.

Background

The reason why this project is being initiated, because there is never enough communication or help when it comes to your education. To see, if the students will communicate more being with people in the same class.

Scope

The project will include where we have to build a tab on the screen where the student can click and to open. It should have the option when it can go full screen or minimize it. The student should be allow to send picture and videos. They will not be able to make a profile for the chat. It will just be the their name only with a picture of themselves. The chat should allow them to direct message each other. But to start the student off they will be set in a permanent group chat with their classmate and their mentor. Once the students graduated the permanent group chat with the students and mentor be deleted. We will be pair mind like students by their quiz and projects.
 
Functional requirements

 This project will require a lot of backend work. The first thing we are going to be working on is embedding in the tab in the exeter. The tab need to stand out, be bold, on the right side of the page. The user should be able to minimize the page or make the chat room full screen. The style of the chat should be warm and inviting and user friendly to use to chat with others. When making the permanent group when the class will be with their mentor. This chat should never be deleted at all. Meaning the user should not be able to delete this group chat from their side. Student should also be allow to direct message each other. These direct message can be delete at anytime by the user. The user will not have a profile, only the name and picture of themselves. As for the what they are allowed to send is pictures, videos, and text. As the student goes along in the class and gets grade on the quizzes and project. It will sort out who thinks alike. It should ask for the mentor or teacher in advice to see if this a good choice to pair them together before it send it to the students. After we get the okay from the mentor it send student suggestions on who to talk to. But if mentor think it is a bad choice, mentor should be allowed to change up the pairing to the system and it should send suggestions on who the students should talk to.

Personnel requirements

Team work make the dream work. As a team I need a focus team who is will dedicate their time to this project. I need person who are confident in their skills and their ability to get the job done. There should be six members on the team. Two people are going to front end the design. Four people to do the backend, which it will be separate by two doing the direct message and permanent message and the others will work on the figure out how to pair up mind like people. This is the perfect team to get the job done!

Delivery schedule

The first section that should be ready to go is the style of the of the tab and the layout of the chat room. It should be warm and inviting to the user. Before you create the  design to make it official, it will go through a voting with the team to see if everyone will like the layout on it. Once everyone is on board, that is when you start design the application to embed it into exeter. While the style of the application is being built, the backend people are going to making the messages are get send to the right person or group chat.
The second part that it should be done is getting making sure the there is no profile only the name and a picture where they can insert it. Making sure, the backend create a group chat message where all the students in the same with mentor will be located and cannot be deleted by the user. The frontend will style out how they want the name and picture to come out the students or mentors are chatting with one another. While making sure to highlight the chat pernament chat the all the classmates will be at the chat with each other. 
The third part of the section that need to completed is the trying to figure how to pair the student that think alike. It can be determine by the quizzes and project test score or the mentor can change the pair to who he think that might be a great pair for it other. After that is determine, the students should get a suggestion pop up on who they should talk who would work great together.
 
Other requirements

The application need storage, which we want to save all the messages that students and mentor send to each other. The message should not be erase, especially if there is something that can help a student in the future. We want the messages to be special. So, since we are going to be saving all message. We need to create bookmarks base on the lesson. It will make it easier to find the old message that can be useful. Also, there should be a option to search it up in the messages.

Assumptions

The application is going to be running off to the exeter frameworks. It should not have any bugs that should be affected that exeter website. The website will not have any google maps api. The application will work on the phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop. The application will be very responsive.

Limitations

The limitations that might be difficult and might be time consuming trying to pair the student to be successful. The costly part of the project will be the storage of the messages that they will send to one another. That is why we will delete permanent group chat when the students graduate to create more storage. We are planning for a smooth sail with no limitations.  

Risks

The risk of the application, is connecting students who think alike. If this failure in the project due to not grab the grade for the quizzes and projects from the student. We will just have make it where that mentor will manually pair the student together who would be the best match for each other. It should still send the student the suggestion to pair up and work together as a team. Also, the risk of the storage being too costly. If that is to happen, we can allow the mentors to save few message for each lesson that will be helpful for the students. So we don’t have to save all the messages, which will be a great way to save money.
